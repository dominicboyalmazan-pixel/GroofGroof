AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA PLEASE I JUST WANT IT TO STOP\",\n          \"I have only 1 person I can somewhat open to but I have only done so to a certain extent and try to refrain from doing it at all for the most part. I feel guilty as if I am bothering them with unfairly dumping my bullshit onto them and as if I am doing it for attention or pity. I honestly have no clue how long this will end up being. Whether this story grosses you out, makes you hate me, or even if you choose not to read it, everything is fine with me. It does not really have a point. I just felt like Id never actually let my thoughts out properly and so this is my trashbin.Was raised in a single mother household and never knew my father. Mother divorced him for being psychotic and threatening not only her life but the lives of his children as well. This was after years of her holding out believing it was her duty to sacrifice herself to let her children have a financially stable home with 2 parents. We ended up in a very low class town with minimal income but my mother worked herself to the bone with low paying jobs in an attempt to make sure we still had as good of a life as she could make. Unfortunately I still ended up being a weird kid. Not really sure why but I have always wondered if I had a disorder that was simply never noticed and properly diagnosed. I know now though that I have severe anxiety problems which were hereditary. She spent every last ounce of her strength just trying to provide for the family so she had very little left over to actually raise the children. Once I got into the public elementary school my weirdness ended up with me never developing any connections. Eventually there was severe bullying. I would never paid any attention to it till my most recent years when I started to reflect on why I am the way I am now, but I know that some of it definitely mentally changed me in very not good ways. Though all these years I never thought of it as such. For what I believe was the reason above I ended up dropping out of the school system after at least a year of problems. The biggest was me refusing to go to school by faking epileptic seizures as a way to get out. I actually had epilepsy but all of the \\\"seizures\\\" I ever had at school were fake. The final nail in the coffin was 1 particularly violent bully beating the shit out of me and stomping my head into the concrete pavement for almost a minute like he was playing dance dance revolution at an arcade. Teacher was too scared to physically stop him I guess? Stayed out of the system for like 3-4 years while the public school shut down. We live in an extremely economically dead town. Like the majority of the towns roughly 1000 population are under the 10k annually mark (including us) and barely survive solely off government benefits and the low cost of living. That was when I first started to seclude myself off. It was not terrible but at the same time I had no real social connections. I did things like go on occasional outings with family members and such but I had no friends or social groups at all. Eventually I started to really dive into my playstation 2 and slowly started sticking there more and more as time went on. My grandparents both finally fell down ill due to old age. My grandmother developed parkinsons and my grandfather went through several bad falls as well as slowly developing dementia. This was an unbearably huge amount of stress on my mother who was already being torn apart by how hard she was struggling to keep the household up. Eventually she decided to sacrifice her job in exchange for taking up the home healthcare position of taking care of my grandparents. With this she would work literally next door to us, be able to take care of her parents when no one else in the family would, and she would still make an income. It was shaky but things were still fine back then. Around the age of 11 or so (bad memory of things back then) she decided to pay a heavy amount of money to put me back into school. There was a VERY small little private school in town that was run by an older gentleman named Mr. G, 3 teachers, and maybe a total student body of 25 or so children in various grades split between those 3. 2 of them were very nice older women named Miss D and then my teacher named Miss N,. I guess I had problems with anxiety but eventually I managed to be somewhat happy. Unfortunately the third teacher, Miss P who was the daughter of Miss D, was a very difficult person. She had extreme anger issues, seemed to just dislike children as a whole, and had absolutely no patience for anyone who lacked. Miss N was a much more Elderly woman than the other 2 and at some point she became far too ill to continue her teaching job. The remaining kids were mostly moved to Miss P's class with the only exceptions being the much younger children in the lower grades. Every single day was a living hell for me. The simplest way to describe it is that she held extreme animosity towards the weaker kids. If you were falling behind in the pace of your work, or if you were not producing grades that she was happy with, or if you did not understand something, she just hated you. When you did something like this she would threaten you, scream at you, talk to you like she was about to physically beat the shit out of you, oftentimes not so subtly threatening to actually do so. She used intimidation like standing directly above you in your seat and silently glaring you down. it would be even worse when she would bend down and put herself right in your face and start with her threatening. Or she would take a heavy book and slam it in front of you. There were at least 2 kids that definitely had learning problems, like a young little blonde boy named Tyler. The poor kid would often be the last to finish his work, or maybe it was even a group of 3 of us. she would slam her hand down on her desk in the corner, look at us like she was about to kill us, and then tell us in the most threatening manner that she could muster \\\"Get it down NOW\\\". The school had a physical discipline policy that was based on parental permission. she would often take Tyler somewhere to beat his ass with a belt when he was not performing like she wanted. The other method she used a lot was what I liken to a military \\\"shark attack\\\". she would take the student to a separate part of the school, plop them down in a chair, and start shouting in their face. She berated them on why they cannot do what she wants them to do, why they cannot do it fast enough, why cannot you understand this or that when you should be able to understand it, and when some poor kid can only respond with \\\"I do not know\\\" she just lays on harder. She always told us that we CAN do it how she wants but we are just lazy or do not want to do it. Or that our parents did not raise us properly.The principal, Mr G, apparently knew about some of this but Miss D did her best to protect her daughter. Some of the parents would become aware of this and many different students over the years would get taken out because they could not handle Miss P. Miss D was honestly a nice and good hearted person but I guess she simply loved her daughter and did not want to see her fired. I still do not know to this day how the school had not been hit with any legal problems but maybe what she was doing was not considered abuse or anything.Eventually history repeated itself and I continued to miss more and more school. I would wake up hours before it was time to leave for school because I was terrified of going and could not sleep. A lot of times I would cry on the way there and beg my mother to not force me to go. I think I had a hard time explaining to her why I hated school so much. She knew the teacher was causing issues but was not sure of what to do. Because she was soft she would let me skip school pretty often on days like that, but she was also pressed as she was paying the school a huge fee monthly for me to go, I was losing a lot of school work due to missing everything, and she was also legally pressed as there was a child law stating that you could not miss so many days of school. Finally after so long of it she mentally could not handle juggling my problematic school life and her other responsibilities so she pulled me out. I was labeled as being homeschooled so we were legally safe but I never touched a single bit of homeschooling work at all. Same situation as before. I had not managed to build any relationships with people and had no connections to social groups. I went back to my little room and continued to play video games. As the years went by I became more and more secluded and slowly degenerated as a person. Stopped interacting with even my family members, stopped leaving the house for days at a time, stopped interacting with my mother, stopped interacting with the house, ect. Then came things like neglecting my basic hygiene, neglecting my responsibility to assist with the household, ect. I am not worried about revealing this as I can remain anonymous but I believe my hygiene and standard of living was probably far below what most people could imagine. At the worst points of it I could have gone a month or over without bathing and years without brushing my teeth. My room had become a literal vile trash heap filled with soda cans, junk, dishes, and rotting food. How I never contracted some horrific disease is beyond me, and somehow I came out with a perfectly healthy set of teeth despite horrible yellowing. Through it all my mother destroyed herself trying to deal with me as a life sucking parasite living in the back of her house and her slowly dying parents that were succumbing to old age and terrible illnesses. I sat by staring at my computer screen, having basically no human interaction with anyone and even amongst online groups still being a weirdo that never got along with people, not paying attention to both her and the house falling apart. Even in my little computer world I was not satisfied though. I still do not understand a lot about myself but I believe I sought out video games as a form of fulfillment as I have nothing else. I looked towards competitive games or extremely grind heavy games as a way of feeling like I could accomplish something and feel like I had worth. Unfortunately I quickly learned that I was pretty mediocre at these things as well. Even if I could happily play a game 10, 12, 14 hours a day I still could not succeed how others could. I started to learn very quickly that regardless of what I dived into I was also lacking. I believe this led to my complex of believing that I am incapable of doing anything at all. Somewhere at around the age of 18 I got some awareness and finally realized where I would gone. Spent all of those years thinking \\\"No way I could end up like this. that is impossible.\\\" and then suddenly I open my eyes and I am already there. Seen my husk of a mother dealing with a dysfunctional family, both from her children and her siblings. Seeing everything I would loved as a child decayed and gone. I had a cousin named Jeff and his father named Sammy who I loved more than anyone else when I was a kid. When I was much younger Jeff died after a life fighting against cancer which left his father and mother broken. Instead of trying to connect with my uncle which could have done us both good I instead spent my time shutting myself off from my family, and eventually he also passed away from a broken heart and crippling illness. I cannot tell you how much I regret that. In 2017 my grandfather finally passed away from his problems, and then about 1 year later my grandmother followed after him. That was the end of my mothers employment and thus any income we had. Her mental state was destroyed by the years of stress and then the loss of her parents, and she was already in her 50's on top of being physically worn out so even if she wanted to try she was no longer fit for work. I was a pile of shit with mental issues who could not even interact with people properly anymore much less join the workforce. What little education I started out with had been completely forgotten and I forget how to even write. I can still write letters but there is almost no way I could handle anything past a few simple words. I only relearned how to write my name in cursive because I had to start filling out my own paperwork in hospitals and such. I never actually remembered or possibly even learned how to use proper grammar and punctuation. What I am doing now is only from me copying what I see other people do and trying to figure out how it is used from there. I have tried self learning things in the past but I get overwhelmed and it feels like I cannot grasp anything no matter what I try. We spent the next several years in financial hell. Begging friends and family for money where we can just to keep utilities and internet on, of course using government programs for things like food stamps. There were plenty of times where we would lose electricity or water anyway as there is a limit to begging and what others can do to help you when they are struggling with their own lives. Our relatives in Texas were a bit more successful and it was in large part thanks to them that we even managed at some points. Even still we have had situations where we lived without water for months before, electricity for weeks, ect. We also managed to rack up a utility debt to the town which is where we would lose the water a lot. It was due to an error on their part where they failed to shut off our gas line and thus charged us for utilities we did not use. We were constantly hit by struggle after struggle but life continued on. Somewhere along the way I developed a back disability. It could have been hereditary, it could have been a random occurrence, or it could have been a result of my terrible lifestyle. I do not know the answer. At first it was not anything major but it slowly progressed to be worse and worse as time went on. After so long we started to piece things back together through a few different methods. Specifically we relied on a deposit that originally belonged to my grandparents but my family handed it over to us since we needed money the most. Then my grandfather's precious car that had decayed away in his garage was also sold. This money at least helped us for a few months until we finally managed to get more government assistance and deal with the town. We managed to get a program that pays for our electricity and then got the town to ignore the debt of our water bill for the time being while we pay a small amount every month to keep it on. Eventually though I started to crack. Over the years I refused to swallow the notion of depression. I had lived my entire life by having my mother take care of me, sacrificing herself to deal with me even though she should not have. I had not changed my ways much but I started to develop a mentality that I did not deserve anything from anyone, especially not the right to be depressed. I would have moments where it would creep up on me, but I would throw it away and ignore it. However time went on and the guilt only piled up. I could not change my ways or do anything to change my life. I am nothing but a burden and I cannot change it. The fact that I would always revert back to my ways and the fact that years went by without any sort of change killed me so much. Then one day about a year ago I watched a motivational video from an old man who started from a truly low position in life. He was a bright and strong old guy who tried to convince the younger generation that they can do it and that he understands that life is hard for people in these times, maybe even harder than it was in his. I watched a few of his videos and the only thing I could think was \\\"I am nothing like this person. I cannot be as strong as this person. I cannot change my life like this person. I am sorry for failing.\\\". that is when I first started hurting myself. was not anything major. Was an old pocket knife and I did not aim deep. And you know? It felt good. Not in a physical way of course. I would been taking so many painkiller/muscle relaxer pills that I did not feel much. However I would always thought that I could not even commit suicide if I wanted to because I would be too weak to even endure the pain or have the guts enough to because it. But those few cuts proved me wrong. I could do it and it was pretty easy, and that made me happy. For about a week I would continue making cuts here and there just to continue reaffirming that feeling of accomplishment. I just passed the cuts off as my huge cat losing his marbles and attacking my arm. Since I would never really interacted with my mother much and never allowed myself to show any sort of symptoms of depression she did not even begin to suspect anything else. But then an argument happened. It was something stupidly simple. I had a pack of meat that I wanted to take out of the freezer to defrost, but it was 2 separate packs joined in the middle by tough plastic. I could not separate it and lazily threw the entire thing into the fridge to defrost. My mother stopped me and proceeded to lecture me about how I always waste so much food and I got annoyed. I just grabbed the meat and was going to chuck it back into the freezer for another time but then she got pissed at that as well and jerked it out from in front of me and started telling me how I am always so childish, impatient, lazy, and \\\"I am beginning to think that you will never change\\\". This one little line broke something. I thought to myself \\\"She also understands that I am worthless and that I will never change or become better\\\". It was like I knew that she knew the entire time but hearing it and thus confirming it is an entirely different thing for me. Even though I of course knew that is not what she meant I could not help but think about these things. I quietly slinked off into my room like I normally do but once I was behind a closed door and was not being bothered I silently broke down. I cried, I laughed at myself, and then I started cutting more. This time was harder. I was angry at myself with how fucking pathetic and disgusting and how much of a soul sucking worm I was. After a few larger cuts than normal I really broke down and finally started going for real deep wounds.Then I looked out of the corner of my eye and noticed an old fish fillet knife on my desk. I enjoy knives as a hobby so I had a lot of different stuff scattered around my room. I took it, thought about what sort of damage I could deal with it, and I was happy at the thought. To avoid explicit details I ended up with 4 deep gashes. I was not sure if I was necessarily thinking of committing suicide with that or not. I almost wanted it but I also avoided cutting directly on the wrist and also remained aware the entire time that I knew a better method to ensure it would work if I committed to it. I did not feel much of anything, maybe not even the slightest burn. could have been adrenaline, could have been the pain meds, could have been both. However as I sat there for a while breaking down further and further while I continued to bleed badly the thought crossed my mind that I could have actually done potentially fatal damage. I never really had a plan to begin with for hiding such massive cuts but they were far beyond the point of just wrapping them up and pretending it was nothing. that is when my legs gave out, my vision blurred, I became ultra light headed, and my arms and hands became extremely numb while tingling super hard. Id suddenly got scared and thought that I might have killed myself somehow. I stumbled to the front of the house and showed my mother what happened. Told her I loved her and was sorry for failing her and then just sat down on the kitchen floor and just kind of blurred out from there. A nearby off duty EMT rushed over and took a look. Nothing fatal as the knife had been dulled over the years without me knowing but stitches were definitely needed so she patched me up as best as she could and I was rushed to a hospital in a far off city. Closest city could not accept me due to covid or something so I ended up going to a larger but further away city. Mother cried so much on the way there and she was absolutely traumatized. Ended up saying goodbye to her at the hospital entrance and then sat in a holding cell for what was probably about 3-4 hours. Went through the process of getting patched up and once day break hit I got shipped off to a mental facility nearby. I spent about a week there. I had more human interaction in that 1 week than I had in the entire 10 years leading up to that point, and most of it was me silently sitting in the corner. Despite that though the facility was not worth anything at all and I am still not sure how people are cured there. Maybe it was a holding facility and not an actual hospital but I do not know and never cared to know. It was just a depressing common room where everyone just sat around in uncomfortable chairs, drank decaffeinated coffee, and tried their best to sleep through the day until they were allowed to go back to their rooms for the night. Met some interesting characters. The people in there ranged from people with major disorders, to people in drug remission, people coming off an alcohol trip, and even something like anger problems. Got to meet a gorgeous young hood girl named Audrey who I instantly developed a crush on and also got to experience what it was like having a roommate even if I absolutely hated it. Was picked up by my mother and uncle after my week was up and really had not received any sort of help or counseling. Id felt like an entirely different person though just finally being around people and even briefly opening up about myself to a few people around me. Had some sort of psychiatrist call center try to help me afterwards but all it amounted to was a group of random people who I formed no connection to calling me up whenever they felt like it to ask me if I was ok and if I needed any more meds. I was probably at fault since Id already had a hard time opening up but I felt even less inclined when it was someone I did not care about or know over the phone. Suddenly for a short bit I had family members swarming around and feeling like they had to somehow help me. Was given my first cellphone as I had not ever needed nor wanted one previously, and not but maybe a few weeks later my cousin contacted me to tell me he wanted me to work a part time job. Its really low hours which works in my favor with my disability and its a simple cleaning job so I can pick it up so easily. I thought of this as a first step that would hopefully give me a mentality that I can do better and I can be of use to people. The money is next to nothing but for the first time in years we do not have to ask someone for assistance the moment we need even the smallest of things. Can keep basic household items around, keep my pets fed, try to keep bills paid, ect. After about 2 or so months I turned towards fixing my back. If my legs recover from the severe muscle pains I experience when walking then I could hold a full time job with good pay and from there its just a slow process of building myself up. The ineptitude I feel, the lack of education that haunts me, the disability that holds me back, all of it could be fixed with some time. I felt so happy and it was such a new feeling that I had not felt in so long. that is when everything quickly came caving in. So far my doctors and related medical procedures were all moving at a crawl. I spent several years dealing with a doctor that had to be demanded to move through several visits before they would actually do something, and I repeatedly kept getting thrown back and forth between tests and random crap. I ended up in physical therapy several times but that never amounted to much because apparently government health insurance does not afford particularly quality or motivated therapy sessions. That went nowhere fast and so Id spent the years up until that point just hopped up on a high dose of painkiller/muscle relaxers. However all of a sudden everything sped up real damn quick. There was immediate discussion about consulting a neurosurgeon which we spent a while trying to find due to not only the limitations on what the state had available but also what we could find with our insurance. Dumb doctor seemed optimistic and told me it should be easily treatable. Finally got to meet my neurosurgeon for the first time and he was even more optimistic. He spun a tale of how so damn easy and quick it would be to fix a busted disc and that even if the back pain was not 100% cured there was no way he could not fix it up so that my legs were not fine again. Said everything was a guaranteed easy operation. So on my very first consultation due to my naivety and stupidly thinking I could trust doctors I agreed to a surgery. Short version of that is several shady things happened with that doctor and after about a month or 2 of recovery I could safely say that not only had the surgery failed but I was not at least 2 or 3 times worse off than I was previously. Now that were later into 2021 I have been told after a follow up visit that the disc is no longer salvageable and the damage may yet get worse as there are signs that more discs will degrade and blow out in the future. A surgery to potentially stop the problem from worsening has been suggested but all of his previous enthusiasm is gone and he believes there is a good chance the rest of my discs will go bad regardless of what happens. For now I am taking more pain meds than before just trying to keep my little job together but who knows when that will start to fail as well. In that time span of my cutting incident to now I rose up higher than Id been in years only to fall lower than Id ever been before mentally. Things like my hygiene have gotten to acceptable levels. I still have anxiety about so many things that eat away at me on a daily basis but I have gotten better at talking to people even if I cannot manage to build social connections. But I have completely lost hope of ever escaping poverty, ever having a body that is not too weak to do what I want, trying to build a normal social life and make up for all those years I wasted, or even escaping from behind my little computer screen. Any time I try to think about it, or when someone tells me what I should be doing, somewhere along in that plan that I am cooking up I reach a roadblock that stems from something of these 3 issues. I have come to hate everything about myself and where I am at now. Even if I try to explain it away I still blame myself for ending up like this. Suicide seems to be the only thing I can think about now as I have lost all form of motivation to even do the things that I once enjoyed. I am simply trying to pass through each day until hopefully I hit another emotional breakdown that will give me the push I want to overcome everything else and just end it. Rather than wasting my time and spending my entire life self loathing and living like this I decided that if nothing changes by the time I am 25 in 2 more years Ill resolve myself to end it if I do not do it sooner. Venting and dumping my story here if that is fine. it is ok if it needs to be removed for whatever reason.\",\n          \"I have been thinking about posting online for a few days now, thinking maybe there is a solution or an angle that I am missing. **This is LONG**. I am starting from the beginning, because I feel like there may be a trend. Also, it almost feels nice laying everything out in the open. I apologize for any problems you may have with the formatting, past and present tense writing, or keeping shitty track of my own timeline. I wrote this on my phone in bed, and ended up emailing it to myself to post it on a burner profile.As the title says, I do not want to die. I just want to feel happy.Ever since I could remember, suicide or death has always been on the radar. I remember getting upset over something as a kid, and saying I wish I were dead. I have always had a temper, and I would often go from 0-60 emotionally extremely fast. I never made any suicide attempts pre-puberty, but the idea would be in my head more frequently as I got older. I was on various medications as far back as I could remember until I was about 16. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was young, and I was suspected to have BPD later on, but I was never fully diagnosed with it. I ended up stopping my meds on my own when I was 16. Once I hit my pre-teen/teenage years, the problems seemed to pick up pace. At some point, seemingly coinciding with the uptick with all my issues, the idea of death and suicide changed from just an idea, to a viable solution to my problems in life. It went from \\\"I wish I were dead\\\", to \\\"I could take my own life and things would not be an issue\\\". My first \\\"attempt\\\" happened in my early teens. Something I cannot remember happened, and I ended up smashing my bedroom window and holding the glass to my neck. My mom and step dad talked me down at the time, and they took me to the hospital where I was assessed and released shortly after them determining I was not a danger to myself anymore. Years 16-20 were probably the best of my life. At some point when I was 15, I had something like an epiphany where I realized I was in control. Everything made sense. If there was a problem or internal conflict with myself, I could sit down and come up with a solution. I understood that I could not rely on my mom for every answer to every problem I had. I went from barely finishing 3 courses a year in grade 10 and attempting to quit, to completely catching up in grades 11 &amp; 12, a 4.0 GPA, acing exams, and making honor roll. I was very introverted in school, but focused on the goals I had set for myself. I never socialized outside of my classroom, but I had regular friends that went to a different school, that I visited on weekends and breaks. After graduating, I got into the work force doing a few different jobs trying to pick a career path. A little over a year went by and I finally got into what I felt was a serious relationship. We were childhood friends, and I was 110% serious on staying with her for the rest of my life. She had a 3 month old girl when we started dating, and I did my best to step into the father role at 20. I was stressed out, money was tight, we lived about an hour away from each other, and she put me through some unnecessary drama. I felt a bit trapped in my job, because it paid good for a 20 year old with no education, and I had to start saving money to build a future with her and the baby. I worked hard, and took any opportunity I could to gain experience and move up. Long story short though, we broke up after about 4 months, with me going through the expected emotional turmoil. I remember being upset one night, and deciding to go for a bike ride at night between my town and the next. It was raining, I was wearing all black, and it was a very busy road. I did not care. I wanted someone to hit me without it being my fault. I made it to the next town without incident however, and I took the bus back home. Despite starting off the ride wishing I would be hit, it ended with feeling proud of myself, not expecting to be able to ride that far. After that night, I started riding my bike frequently. I would push myself further at every opportunity, it was like a mixture of meditation and blowing off steam. At nights to relax and get out to blow off more steam, I would end up walking into my town every night, buying a tea, and walking back home. For whatever reason, walking made me want to start running. I eventually took up running in addition to biking, and I even considered taking part in triathlon the following year. I was one of my walks one day, still a bit hung up on my failed relationship, and I was hit by another epiphany. I had no commitments, no debt, I was in the best shape I had ever been in, I was suddenly incredibly high on life. That was the moment I decided that I was going to chase my dream trip, and that I was going to go work up north to save money for it. That summer was the best time of my life. I partied a few times every weekend, I made life long friends, I lived every moment to the fullest. Eventually the fall came, partying season was over, and it was time to get to work. I quit my dead end job, gave my car away, packed a suitcase, and flew up north to stay with my biological dad and my step family. My plan was to work away from home for a year, and move back after my trip. They let me stay in their basement living room on the couch, helped me get some oilfield certificates, and pointed me in the direction to find a good paying job. Eventually I got a job at a heavy duty mechanics shop. I worked there for about 3 months trying to get into an apprenticeship. I was a little stressed out from living out of a suitcase and sleeping on a couch every night, I was working about 11 hour days 6 days a week, but it was all for my trip so every paycheck seemed like a step forward. I continued to exercise to blow off steam. Eventually, the stress compounded too much and I was in need of some change. There were not enough journeymen to sponsor me for an apprenticeship, and things seemed to hit a dead end. I received an opportunity to work on the railway around this time, which involved relocating. Hotel rooms and meal allowance was provided so I jumped on it. For the rest of the season into winter I worked hard. The physical labor was intense and sometimes dangerous, working up to 18 hours a day every now and then. I was making money hand over fist and saving money like mad. It was not long before I had enough for my trip, but I kept working the rest of the season to make extra, only going home to see family and friends about every 2-3 months. My grandmother passed away while I was up there working, and I came home to be with family. I ended up asking for the winter off to take my trip because it seemed like a good time to do it. I went on my trip to this country for the second time, but all alone. I was diving head first into a completely different language and culture with no one there to catch me if I fell. I explored, I got lost, I had to work my own way through challenges, I learned a lot. After about 4 weeks I decided to return home, going through most of my budget and kind of feeling homesick. For the next few months, I roomed with some buddies and chilled out until the work season started again. I started a relationship with a girl before the trip, and picked up where we left off when I came home. Springtime, the railway maintenance season starts. I start taking on more responsibilities at work, and only staying out for 1-2 months at a time. This is where life started to degrade. I worked the usual long hours, took on more stress, but I was making money and learning lots. The stress was constant though. You were usually under pressure from a train coming at some point, and everything had to be done properly so it could pass over your work safely. Causing a derailment would be disastrous, and potentially deadly. Over the years I continued to take on more responsibilities, learning new roles and working long hours. I think the second season was when I started to disassociate a bit to power through the long hours and miserable work. I started to drink regularly as an outlet instead of exercising, thinking I had enough of a work out during the day to justify some beers. As well, life on the road/hotel rooms meant that you were usually eating out or eating shitty meals. I gained about 100lbs in four years. Maybe eating out was a way to cope as well. This lifestyle continues today. I lost the weight a few times, but it always came back fast because of the overall lifestyle and stress. Fast forward to 27 years old. Still doing long hours, pretty jaded from the work and lifestyle, and still heavy. My girlfriend has stuck around through all of this somehow. I was coming home every few weeks though, so that was pretty cool. For probably a few reasons, I developed some severe anxiety issues. It got to the point where I was pacing in my hotel room, with intrusive thoughts telling me I should kill myself. I would be in tears, the only way out was to die. I usually ended up smoking weed pretty heavily to numb myself and go to bed. I decide to get some help from my doctor, who referred me to a psychiatrist. My schedule meant that appointments would be very spread out and change would be painfully slow. After about a year, we finally managed to get me leveled out and my anxiety down about 50% with the help of some medication. I switched companies in the same industry for some more money and better opportunities. Still long hours on the road though, same stress, and living out of hotel rooms. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that I was dissociated to the point where the days would pass by and I would not remember much. I do not even blink at a 20 hour day anymore. I do not feel anything. I do not the have passion that I once had, no happiness, no enjoyment, excitement, or entertainment. I lost my hobbies pretty much when started my first year, and I always focused my spare time on visiting people or running errands while at home. Things got bad enough to the point where if I had more than a week off work, I would have angry outbursts/withdrawal from work. Even though I going home more, I did not know how to enjoy myself or blow off steam anymore. I think all the hours at work, combined with the schedule, made me dysfunctional.That brings me to this year. New position in management, significantly less money but more experience for the resume. I still hate the industry, and I am still on the road 90% of the year. reached out to my doctor again because the suicidal ideation has returned. It took about 3 months, but I was eventually set up with a psychiatrist again. She did not do much though. She took me off some of my old meds and doubled another. We probably only had about 4 or 5 appointments over the phone before she said she could not help me. Now here I am. I am going through depressive episodes again, thinking the only way is suicide. I am in debt from stupid decisions over the years, I am fat, with no goals or hobbies, no savings, living paycheck to paycheck, priced out of the housing market because I did not buy in my early to mid 20's, and the doctors gave up on me. I turn 30 in a few months, and I have decided that if life has not turned around or I have not had another \\\"epiphany\\\" by then, I am going to bring things to an end. I have not made any attempts because I am not ready. it is going to be a one time thing with 100% certainty, and I do not want to humiliate myself by not succeeding. I have the plan figured out, but I will not share the details here because I do not want to give anyone ideas. I do not want to die, it will devastate my girlfriend, the same one I have had from the beginning of all this crap. It will probably ruin my mother, family, and close friends. I will never see my cats again. The last thing I would ever want to do is hurt anyone. But life has not been going the right direction for almost a decade now, and things only seem to be getting worse. I am tired. I do not want to die\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"status\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Suicidal\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"num_of_characters\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 9427,\n        \"min\": 10219,\n        \"max\": 32759,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          25302\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"num_of_sentences\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 431,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1260,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The next line df['statement'] = df['original_statement'].str.lower() creates a new column named statement with all text converted to lowercase using the str.lower() function.\n",

        "This step helps prepare the text for further preprocessing. Lowercasing ensures that the model does not treat the same words differently just because of capitalization, making text analysis more consistent and accurate."

The code r'http[s]?://\\S+' removes URLs, r'\\[.*?\\]\\(.*?\\)' removes markdown-style links, r'@\\w+' removes handles that start with “@”, and r'[^\\w\\s]' removes punctuation and special characters. The strip() function removes any extra spaces from the start and end of the text.\n",

        "The function remove_stopwords(text) first loads a list of common English stopwords using stopwords.words('english'). Then, it splits the text into individual words using word_tokenize(text). A list comprehension filters out the words that appear in the stopwords list. Finally, ' '.join(filtered_words) combines the remaining words back into a clean sentence.\n",

        "**Inputs:**\n",
        "The input is the cleaned statement column, which no longer contains punctuation, special characters, or URLs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Outputs:**\n",
        "The output is an updated statement column with stopwords removed.\n",

        "Example:\n",

        "*   Cleaned: “gr gr dreaming ex crush game god”\n",
        "\n",
        "**Comments and Observations:**\n",
        "This step makes the text data cleaner and more focused by removing words that add little meaning. It improves the model’s ability to detect emotional or suicidal expressions by emphasizing key words that reflect intent or mental state."

Each word is lemmatized and converted to lowercase inside a list comprehension. Finally, the words are joined back into a clean sentence using ' '.join(lemmatized_words).\n",
        "The line df['statement'] = df['statement'].apply(lemmatize_text) applies this process to every statement in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inputs:**\n",
        "The input is the cleaned statement column containing lowercased and tokenized text without stopwords or special characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Outputs:**\n",
        "The output is an updated statement column where each word is replaced with its lemmatized (base) form.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Comments and Observations:**\n",
        "This step differs from tokenization because tokenization only splits text into words, while lemmatization transforms each word into its simplest form. Lemmatization makes the dataset more uniform, helping the model recognize patterns in word meaning rather than just surface forms."

It’s basically the foundation that allows me to load and use advanced models without having to train them from scratch.\n",

It makes it easy to load, split, and preprocess data, which is really useful when preparing text for BERT-based models. Meanwhile, I installed `torch` because it’s the deep learning framework that powers these transformer models  it handles all the computations that happen behind the scenes during model training and prediction.\n",

Adding the `-q` flag just runs the installation quietly, so it doesn’t flood the notebook with too much text output. Overall, this setup ensures that everything I need for deep learning and NLP is ready before I start working with MentalBERT."

These metrics give a more complete view of performance, especially for a binary classification task like detecting suicidal vs. normal statements.\n",

The `Trainer` and `TrainingArguments` handle the training process  they make it easier to define how the model trains, tracks progress, and saves checkpoints. Together, these imports set up everything I need to fine-tune MentalBERT efficiently."

Inside the `__init__ `method, I passed in the text data, the corresponding labels, the tokenizer, and a `max_len` parameter (which I set to 64).

During this process, the model updates the weights in the last layers I left unfrozen, while keeping the lower layers frozen, as we set earlier. The Trainer automatically handles batching, backpropagation, and saving checkpoints at the end of each epoch, making the fine-tuning workflow much smoother.\n",

        "After training, I ran `trainer.evaluate()` on the validation dataset to measure how well the model performs on unseen examples. This step calculates the metrics I defined earlier  accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall  so I can get a clear picture of the model’s effectiveness in distinguishing between Normal and Suicidal statements.\n",

Looking at the other metrics, the `F1-score is 0.9722, precision is 0.9809`, and recall is 0.9638, which tells me that the model is not only accurate but also balanced in identifying both Normal and Suicidal statements. High precision means it’s rarely misclassifying Normal statements as Suicidal, and high recall means it’s catching most of the Suicidal statements correctly.\n",

        "The runtime metrics show the model evaluated quickly, with `20.78 seconds total and about 260 samples per second`, which is efficient given the size of the validation set. Overall, these results suggest that the model has learned the task well, and the fine-tuning setup  including the frozen layers and adjusted epochs  worked effectively."
