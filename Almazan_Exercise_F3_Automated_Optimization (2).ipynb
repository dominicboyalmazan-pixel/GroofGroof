It’s basically the foundation that allows me to load and use advanced models without having to train them from scratch.\n",

It makes it easy to load, split, and preprocess data, which is really useful when preparing text for BERT-based models. Meanwhile, I installed `torch` because it’s the deep learning framework that powers these transformer models  it handles all the computations that happen behind the scenes during model training and prediction.\n",

        "Lastly, I added `sklearn` since it includes tools for model evaluation and preprocessing that I’ll still use alongside the transformer model. Adding the `-q` flag just runs the installation quietly, so it doesn’t flood the notebook with too much text output. Overall, this setup ensures that everything I need for deep learning and NLP is ready before I start working with MentalBERT.\n"

These metrics give a more complete view of performance, especially for a binary classification task like detecting suicidal vs. normal statements.\n",

The `Trainer` and `TrainingArguments` handle the training process  they make it easier to define how the model trains, tracks progress, and saves checkpoints. Together, these imports set up everything I need to fine-tune MentalBERT efficiently.\n"
